# CAPSTONE
This repository contains the codes for using an FPGA(Basys3) as an accelerator for a microcontroller(mkl25z). 
Subsequently, it contains the following:
 i) Python code for the training environment
 ii) VHDL code for programming the FPGA
 iii) C and VHDL code for interfacing the microcontroller and FPGA
